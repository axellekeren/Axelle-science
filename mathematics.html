<p>The branch of study known as the history of mathematics is the investigation of the origins of discoveries in mathematics and, to a lesser extent, the investigation of mathematical methods and notation in the past.

    Before modern times and the spread of science throughout the world, written examples of the development of mathematics had shone in only a few places. The most ancient mathematical writings that have been discovered are Plimpton 322 (Babylonian mathematics around 1900 BC), the Rhind Mathematical Sheet (Egyptian mathematics around 2000-1800 BC) and the Moscow Mathematical Sheet (Egyptian mathematics around 1890 BC). All of these papers discuss a theorem commonly known as the Pythagorean theorem, which appears to be the oldest and most widespread mathematical development after elementary arithmetic and geometry.
    
    The contribution of Greek mathematicians refined methods (especially through the introduction of deductive reasoning and mathematical rigor in mathematical proof) and expanded the subject matter of mathematics. The word "mathematics" itself is derived from the ancient Greek word, μάθημα (mathema), which means "subject". Chinese mathematics made early contributions, including positional notation. The Hindu-Arabic number system and its operating rules, used today, were probably developed through lectures in the first millennium AD in Indian mathematics and were passed on to the West through Islamic mathematics. Islamic mathematics, in turn, developed and extended mathematical knowledge to this civilization. Many Greek and Arabic texts on mathematics were later translated into Latin, leading to the further development of mathematics in the European Middle Ages.
    
    From ancient times through the Middle Ages, bursts of mathematical creativity were often followed by centuries of stagnation. Beginning in the Italian Renaissance in the 16th century, the development of new mathematics, interacting with new scientific discoveries, led to exponential growth that continues to this day.
    
    Prehistoric mathematics
    
    Prehistoric mathematics refers to the development of mathematics in ancient times BC.
    The origins of mathematical thinking lie in the concepts of number, quantity and shapes. Modern studies of animal fossils show that this concept is not unique to humans. This concept may also be an everyday part of the hunting pack. That the concept of number evolved step by step over time is evident in that some contemporary languages preserve the distinction between "one", "two", and "many", but numbers greater than two do not. The oldest known mathematical object is the Lebombo bone, found in the Lebombo mountains in Swaziland and probably dating to 35,000 BC. This bone contains 29 different nicks that were intentionally scratched into the baboon's fibula. There is evidence that women used to count to remember their menstrual cycles; 28 to 30 scratches on bone or stone, followed by distinct markings. Also prehistoric artifacts found in Africa and France, dating to 35,000 BC and 20,000 years old, indicate early attempts to date.
    
    The Ishango bone, found near the waterhole of the Nile River (northeast Congo), contains a series of stick marks etched in three longitudinal stripes on the bone. The general interpretation is that the Ishango bones represent the oldest known demonstration of a sequence of prime numbers or a six-month lunar calendar. The Predynastic Period of Egypt from the 5th millennium BC, graphically displays geometric designs. It has been recognized that megalithic buildings in England and Scotland, from the 3rd millennium BC, incorporated geometric ideas such as circles, ellipses and Pythagorean triples in their designs.</p>
