<h1>What is tectonics plates ? </h1>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Tectonic_plates_%282022%29.svg" alt="......" width="600" height="300">
<p>Plate tectonics is a major theory in the field of geology that was developed to provide an explanation for the evidence of large-scale movements carried out naturally by the Earth's lithosphere. This theory has included and replaced the theory of continental drift which was put forward in the first half of the 20th century and the concept of sea floor spreading which was developed in the 1960s.

    In short, because the outermost part of the earth's interior is formed by two layers. At the top there is the lithosphere which consists of the crust and the top part of the Earth's mantle whose contents are stiff and dense. Below the lithosphere layer there is the asthenosphere which is solid but can flow like a liquid very slowly and on a very long geological time scale because of its low viscosity and shear strength. Going deeper, the part of the mantle below the asthenosphere becomes even stiffer. The cause is not colder temperatures, but high pressure.
    
    The lithosphere layer is divided into tectonic plates. On earth, there are seven main plates and many smaller plates. These lithospheric plates ride on top of the asthenosphere. They move relative to each other at plate boundaries, either divergent (moving apart), convergent (colliding), or transform (sideways). Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain building, and oceanic trench formation all commonly occur in areas along plate boundaries. Lateral plate movement usually has a speed of 50-100 mm/a.</p>
    <p>Here are some important points about tectonic plates:</p>
    
  <p> 1. **Composition**: Tectonic plates consist of the hard parts of the Earth's crust known as the lithosphere. The lithosphere consists of thicker continental crust and thinner oceanic crust.</p> 
    
  <p> 2. **Movement**: These plates move very slowly, at a speed of several centimeters to several tens of centimeters each year. This movement can be caused by pushing forces caused by convection movements in the Earth's mantle below.</p> 
    
   <p>3. **Boundaries**: Plates meet at boundaries known as plate boundaries. There are three main types of plate boundaries: divergent boundaries (boundaries that move away from each other), convergent boundaries (boundaries that move towards each other), and transform boundaries (boundaries that move across each other).</p> 
    
   <p> 4. **Effect**: The movement of tectonic plates has a major impact on the Earth's crust, creating ocean basins, mountains, volcanoes, and earthquakes. It also influences climate patterns and the distribution of flora and fauna on the earth's surface.</p>
  
    <p>An understanding of plate tectonics has helped scientists understand the Earth's geology, form theories about climate change, and even predict some natural disasters.</p>
    <h1>Theoretical Development</h1>
    <p>In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, geologists assumed that the Earth's major features were fixed. Most geological features such as mountains can be explained by vertical movements of the crust as explained in geosyncline theory. Since 1596, it has been observed that the coast of the Atlantic Ocean facing the continents of Africa and Europe with North America and South America has similar shapes and appears to have once been one. This precision will become clearer if we look at the edges of the continental shelf there. Since then many theories have been put forward to explain this, but all have failed because the assumption that the earth is completely solid makes it difficult to find a suitable explanation.

        The discovery of radium and its heating properties in 1896 prompted a reassessment of the age of the earth, because previously estimates were obtained from its cooling rate and assuming the earth's surface radiated like a black body. From these calculations it can be concluded that even if initially the Earth was a red-glowing object, the Earth's temperature would decrease to what it is now within a few tens of millions of years. With this newly discovered heat source, scientists consider it plausible that the Earth is actually much older and its core is still hot enough to be in a liquid state.
        
        The theory of plate tectonics originates from the continental drift hypothesis put forward by Alfred Wegener in 1912.and developed further in his book The Origin of Continents and Oceans, published in 1915. He argued that the continents that now exist were once a single unit that moved apart, thus releasing the continents from the earth's core like 'ice chunks' from granite. low density floating on a sea of denser basalt. However, without detailed evidence and calculations of the forces involved, this theory was marginalized. It is possible that the Earth has a solid crust and a liquid core, but it still seems unlikely that parts of the crust could move around. Later, the theory put forward by British geologist Arthur Holmes in 1920 was proven that the link between these parts of the crust might exist under the sea. The theory is also proven that convection currents in the Earth's mantle are the driving force.
        
        The first evidence that the plates were indeed moving came from the discovery of differences in the direction of the magnetic field in rocks of different ages. This discovery was first stated at a symposium in Tasmania in 1956. Initially, this discovery was included in the theory of earth expansion, but then it led more to the development of the theory of plate tectonics which explains spreading as a consequence of vertical movement ( upwelling) of rocks, but avoids the need for the earth to continue to increase in size or expand (expanding earth) by including subduction zones and translation faults. It was at that time that the theory of plate tectonics changed from a radical theory to a theory that was commonly used and then widely accepted among scientists. Further research on the relationship between seafloor spreading and geomagnetic reversal by geologist Harry Hammond Hess and oceanographer Ron G. Mason pinpointed the mechanism that explains the vertical movement of rocks. new.
        
        As the Earth's magnetic anomalies were accepted as represented by symmetrical parallel bands with equal magnetization on the seabed on both sides of the mid-oceanic ridge, plate tectonics became widely accepted. Rapid advances in early seismic imaging techniques in and around the Wadati-Benioff zone and a variety of other geological observations soon established plate tectonics as a theory with extraordinary capabilities in terms of explanation and prediction.
        
        Research on the deep seabed, a branch of marine geology that developed rapidly in the 1960s, played an important role in the development of this theory. Correspondingly, the theory of plate tectonics was also developed in the late 1960s and has been accepted quite universally in all scientific disciplines, while also renewing the world of earth science by providing explanations for various kinds of geological phenomena and also their implications in other fields such as paleogeography and paleobiology. .</p>
    <h1>composition about tectonic plates</h1>
    <p>The composition of tectonic plates consists of the earth's crust and the upper part of the mantle which forms the lithosphere. The following are the main components of tectonic plates:</p>
    <p>1. Crust :</p>
    <p>The earth's crust is the thin and dense outer layer of the earth. It consists of two main types: continental crust and oceanic crust.</p>
    <p>Continental crust is usually thicker and lighter than oceanic crust. It consists of granite rocks that are rich in silica and aluminum.</p>
    <p>Oceanic crust is usually thinner and denser, consisting of basalt rock rich in iron and magnesium.</p>
    <p>2.Earth's mantle:</p>
    <p>The mantle is the layer of earth that lies beneath the crust. This is a very hot and weak layer beneath the earth's crust.</p>
    <p>The upper part of the mantle, called the asthenosphere, has high viscosity and is capable of flowing like a liquid over very long time scales.</p>
    <p>The lower part of the mantle is denser and stiffer, called the undercoat.</p>
    <p>3.Lithosphere:</p>
    <p>The lithosphere is the solid and rigid part of the earth consisting of the earth's crust and the upper part of the mantle.</p>
    <p>The lithosphere is broken up into tectonic plates that move relative to each other over the softer asthenosphere.</p>
    <p>The movement and interaction of these plates above the Earth's mantle creates various geological phenomena such as earthquakes, volcanoes, mountains, and rifts. The movement of tectonic plates also has a major impact on landforms, climate patterns, and biological evolution on Earth. Understanding the composition of tectonic plates helps scientists understand the dynamics of the Earth and predict geological events that can affect life on our planet.</p>
    <h1>The movement of tectonic plates</h1>
    <p>The movement of tectonic plates is the relative movement between large pieces of the earth's crust called tectonic plates. This movement occurs above the asthenosphere, the lower layer of the earth's crust which is quite soft, and is triggered by forces originating from within the earth. The following are several types of tectonic plate movement:</p>
    <p>1.convergence:</p>
    <p>Convergence occurs when two tectonic plates move towards each other.</p>
    <p>At convergent boundaries, one plate may sink beneath another plate in a process called subduction.</p>
    <p>Convergence often results in the formation of mountains, volcanoes, and deep ocean basins.</p>
    <p>2.Divergence</p>
    <p>Divergence occurs when two tectonic plates move away from each other.</p>
    <p>At divergent boundaries, magma can rise from the Earth's mantle to the surface, forming ocean and rift boundaries.</p>
    <p>Divergence causes the formation of ocean basins, such as the Red Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
    <p>3.Transform:</p>
    <p>Transformation occurs when two tectonic plates slide horizontally towards each other.</p>
    <p>At transform boundaries, plate sliding causes earthquakes.</p>
    <p>A famous example of a transform boundary is the San Andreas fault in California.</p>
    <p>The movement of tectonic plates is very slow, usually a few centimeters to several tens of centimeters per year. Although its speed may seem insignificant on human time scales, this movement caused major changes in the Earth's surface over millions of years, forming and changing oceans, land, and mountain ranges. Plate movements also contribute to the occurrence of important geological events such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.</p>
    <h1>types of plate boundaries</h1>
    <p>1.Divergent Boundaries:</p>
    <p>At divergent boundaries, tectonic plates move away from each other.</p>
    <p>The main phenomenon associated with divergent boundaries is the formation of ocean valleys or rifts.</p>
    <p>Rift formation is the beginning of the process of forming new oceans, when magma rises from within the earth and pushes the plates away from each other, creating gaps between them.</p>
    <p>An example of a divergent boundary is the Mid-Atlantic Dorsum, a place where the Eurasian and American plates move away from each other, creating the Mid-Atlantic basin.</p>
    <p>2.Convergent Boundaries</p>
    <p>At convergent boundaries, tectonic plates move toward each other.</p>
    <p>The main phenomenon associated with convergent boundaries is subduction, when one tectonic plate slides under another plate.</p>
    <p>The subduction process can create deep ocean trenches and volcanoes above the upper plate.</p>
    <p>An example of a convergent boundary is a subduction zone along the Pacific Ring of Fire, where the Pacific plate moves beneath a continental plate such as the American or Eurasian plates.</p>
    <p>3.Transform Boundaries</p>
    <p>At transformation boundaries, tectonic plates move across each other horizontally.</p>
    <p>The main phenomenon associated with transform boundaries is shear, where the pressure exerted by plate movement causes earthquakes.</p>
    <p>A well-known example of a transform boundary is the San Andreas fault in California, where the Pacific and American plates move horizontally towards each other.</p>
    <p>Each type of plate boundary has unique geological characteristics and impacts, and understanding them is important in understanding geological processes at the Earth's surface.</p>
    <h1>List of tectonic plates</h1>
    <p>Earth has seven major plates and many minor plates. Small plates themselves occur as a result of the splitting of large plates. The main tectonic plates are:</p>
    <h3>Big plate</h3>
    <p>African Plate, covering Africa - Continental plate.</p>
    <p>Antarctic Plate, includes Antarctica - Continental plate.</p>
    <p>Indo-Australian Plate, covering Australia (merged with the Indian Plate between 50 to 55 million years ago)- Continental plate.</p>
    <p>Eurasian Plate, covering Asia and Europe - Continental plate.</p>
    <p>North American Plate, covering North America and northeastern Siberia - Continental plate.</p>
    <p>South American Plate, covering South America - Continental plate.</p>
    <p>Pacific Plate, covering the Pacific Ocean - Oceanic plate.</p>
    <h3>Small Plate</h3>
    <p>Indian Plate - covers the South Asian continent</p>
    <p>Arabian Plate - covers the Arabian continent</p>
    <p>Lempeng Karibia - meliputi Pulau - pulau Antilles dan Karibia</p>
    <p>Juan de Fuca Plate</p>
    <p>Cocos Plate</p>
    <p>Nazca Plates</p>
    <P>Lempeng Filipina</P>
    <h3>Microplates</h3>
    <P>Sunda Plate</P>
    <p>Caroline Plate</p>
    <p>Adriatic Plate</p>
    <p>Anatolian Plate</p>
    <p>Scotia Plate</p>
    <p>Banda Sea Plate, and Timor Plate.</p>
    <p>Plate movements have caused the formation and breakup of continents over time, including the formation of supercontinents that cover almost all or all of the continents. The supercontinent Rodinia is thought to have formed 1 billion years ago and encompassed almost all or all of Earth's continents and split into eight continents around 600 million years ago. These eight continents then reorganized into another supercontinent called Pangaea which in the end also split into Laurasia (which became North America and Eurasia), and Gondwana (which became the remaining continents)</p>
