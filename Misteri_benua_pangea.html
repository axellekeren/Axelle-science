      <h1>What is pangea?</h1>
      <img src="file:///C:/Users/MDComputer/Pictures/main-qimg-b47236be783ab5135dc40003143dd98c-pjlq.jpg" alt="......."width="600"height="700">
      <p>The continent of Pangea was a supercontinent that existed on Earth during the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic periods, from about 335 million years ago to about 175 million years ago. Pangea was a single continent that united almost all the land on Earth into one large unit.

        During its existence, Pangea was surrounded by a global ocean called Panthalassa. This continental divide began around 175 million years ago into two large parts, Laurasia in the north and Gondwana in the south. These fragments eventually continued to separate into the continents we know today, including North America, South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia and Antarctica.
        
        The movement of tectonic plates was the main cause of Pangea's breakup, and this movement continues today, causing the continents to continually move and change position.</p>
     <h1>The continent Pangea was formed because?</h1>
          <p>The continent of Pangea was formed due to plate tectonic processes. Plate tectonics is the movement of the earth's plates which consist of the earth's crust and the upper part of the mantle. These plates move over a weaker, hotter layer called the asthenosphere.

        The following is the process of forming Pangea:
        
        1. **Plate Convergence**: Before Pangea formed, there were several different continents and oceans. Tectonic plates move towards each other (convergence) and result in collisions between continents.
        
        2. **Continental Merger**: The collision between the continents caused them to merge into one large continent called Pangea.
        
        3. **Time Process**: This process took place over hundreds of millions of years, starting from the Carboniferous period to the end of the Paleozoic period.
        
        4. **Erosion and Sedimentation**: Geological processes such as erosion and sedimentation also influence the formation and change of continents.
        
        Pangea was the end result of this tectonic cycle. Once formed, Pangea remained stable for some time until it finally began to break apart again due to the continuous movement of the plates.</p>
        <h1>Proof of existence</h1>
        <img src="file:///C:/Users/MDComputer/Pictures/main-qimg-b47236be783ab5135dc40003143dd98c-pjlq.jpg" alt="......."width="600"height="700">
        <p>As Alfred Wegener noticed in the early 20th century, Earth's continents seem to fit together like a jigsaw puzzle in many regions around the world. This is significant evidence for the existence of Pangea millions of years ago. The most prominent places where this is seen are the northwestern coast of Africa and the eastern coast of South America. At that location, the two continents looked like they were once connected, which they were, in fact, during Pangea.

            Other evidence for Pangea includes the distribution of fossils, distinctive patterns in rock strata in currently unconnected parts of the world and the global distribution of coal. In terms of fossil distribution, archaeologists have discovered fossil remains that match ancient species on continents separated by thousands of miles of ocean. For example, suitable reptile fossils have been found in Africa and South America indicating that these species at one time lived so close to each other that it was impossible for them to cross the Atlantic Ocean.
            
            Patterns in rock strata are another indicator of Pangea's existence. Geologists have discovered distinct patterns in rocks on continents now thousands of miles apart. By having matching patterns it shows that the two continents and their rocks were at one time one continent.
            
            Finally, the world distribution of coal is evidence for the existence of Pangea. Coal usually forms in warm, wet climates. However, geologists have discovered coal beneath the extremely cold and dry layers of ice beneath Antarctica. If Antarctica is part of Pangea, it is likely to be in another location on Earth and the climate when the coal was formed was very different from what it is today</p>
        <h1>What animals existed when the continent of Pangea still existed?</h1>
       <p>When the continent of Pangea still existed, many types of animals lived on earth, including various types of animals that are now extinct. Since Pangea's period of existence spanned the late Paleozoic to early Mesozoic (approximately 335 million to 175 million years ago), the animals included:</p>

       <p>1. **Fish**: Various types of fish, including bony fish and cartilaginous fish, have thrived in oceans and rivers.</p> 
        
      <p> 2. **Amphibians**: Amphibians such as temnospondyls were a group of animals that developed at that time.</p> 
        
       <p>3. **Reptiles**: Reptiles began to appear and develop rapidly during this period. These include pelicans, species such as labyrinthosaurs, and some land reptiles such as pareiasaurus.</p> 
        
       <p> 4. **Synapsida**: Synapsida is a group of animals that includes the ancestors of modern mammals. Examples include dimetrodon and therapsida.</p>
        
        <p>5. **Dinosaurs**: Dinosaurs began to appear in the Triassic period and became the dominant animals on land during the Mesozoic. They include species such as Coelophysis, Plateosaurus, and several other types of early dinosaurs.</p>
        
        <p>6. **Invertebrates**: Various types of invertebrates, such as trilobites and brachiopods, lived in the sea during this time.</p>
        
      <p> 7. **Flora**: Apart from animals, various types of ancient plants such as ferns, tree ferns, and conifers also flourished during this period.</p> 
        
        Pangea offered a vast and varied environment that allowed many different types of animals and plants to thrive. During this time, animal and plant species experienced many changes and adaptations to face the changing environment.
        <h1>Will Pangea form again in the future?</h1>
        <p>Pangea may form again in the future in the form of a new supercontinent. This process is referred to as the supercontinent cycle, in which tectonic plates move and present-day continents collide and recombine into one supercontinent.

            The supercontinent cycle lasts for hundreds of millions of years. Each cycle involves a period when the continents broke apart, joined to form a supercontinent, and then broke apart again. The last supercontinent to form before Pangea was Rodinia, which existed approximately 1.3 billion to 750 million years ago.
            
            The future supercontinent, sometimes referred to as "Pangea Proxima" or "Neopangea," may form in the next 100-250 million years. However, there are various theories regarding how this future supercontinent will form:
            
           <P>- **Continental Convergence**: Current continents can move towards each other and collide to form one large supercontinent.</P> 
            
           <p>- **Plate Tectonics**: Tectonic plates will continue to move, causing the continents to gradually shift until they finally join back together.</p> 
            
          <p> - **Environment and Geography**: Climate patterns, environmental changes, and geological activity will also influence the formation of future supercontinents.</p> 
            
            Although the future formation of supercontinents seems possible based on Earth's tectonic cycles, much uncertainty remains regarding their exact shape and timing.</p>
