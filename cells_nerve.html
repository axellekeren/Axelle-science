        <h1>Welcome to the AXELLEscience website</h1>
        <p>Nerve cells, or neurons, are the basic units of the nervous system responsible for the transmission of information throughout the body. Neurons have a unique structure consisting of a cell body, dendrites (short projections for receiving signals), and axons (long projections for sending signals). Neurons communicate through electrical impulses and chemical signals, enabling the coordination of various body functions, such as movement, sensation, and thinking. Neurons also form complex networks that allow the brain and nervous system to work efficiently.</p>

  <h1>Neuron</h1>
  <hr/>
  <p>Neurons are nerve cells which are the basic unit of the nervous system. Neurons function to send and receive information throughout the body through electrical impulses and chemical signals. The structure of a neuron consists of three main parts:</p>
  <p>1. **Cell Body**: Also known as the soma, this is the control center of the neuron that contains the nucleus and other organelles.</p>
  <p>2. **Dendrites**: Dendrites are short branches that receive signals from other neurons or external sources and carry them to the cell body.</p>
  <p>3. **Axon**: Axon is a long fiber that transmits signals from the cell body to other neurons or to target cells, such as muscles or glands</p>
  <p>Neurons communicate with other neurons through synapses, which are tiny gaps through which chemical signals are released to carry information from one neuron to another. Neurons play an important role in various body functions, including movement, sensation, thinking, emotions, and organ regulation. Networks of neurons form the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system, which control almost all body activities.</p>
  <h1>Structure</h1>
  <p>Neurons, or nerve cells, have a unique structure that allows them to send and receive information efficiently. The structure of a neuron consists of several main parts:</p>
  <p>1. **Cell Body (Soma)**: The cell body is the center of the neuron which contains the cell nucleus and other cell organelles. Here, neurons process information received from their dendrites and produce proteins and other molecules necessary for cell function.</p>
  <p>2. **Dendrites**: Dendrites are short, branching projections that receive signals from other neurons. They function as antennas that receive information and carry it to the cell body.</p>
  <p>3. **Axon**: Axon is a long projection that transmits signals from the cell body to other neurons or to target cells such as muscles or glands. Axons are often protected by a myelin sheath, which increases the speed of electrical signal transmission.</p>
  <p>4. **Axon Terminal**: An axon terminal, or axon tip, is the structure at the end of an axon that communicates with other neurons or target cells through synapses. Axon terminals release neurotransmitters to transmit signals to other cells.</p>
  <p>5. **Synapse**: A synapse is a small gap between the axon terminal of one neuron and the dendrite of another neuron or target cell. At synapses, neurotransmitters are released to transmit information from one cell to another.</p>
  <p>In addition, some neurons have additional structures such as myelin sheaths, which consist of glial cells and protect the axons, increasing the speed of electrical impulses. The combination of these parts allows neurons to function efficiently in sending and receiving information throughout the body.</p>
  <h1>Grouping</h1>
  <p>Based on their function, nerve cells can be divided into 3 groups, namely:</p>
  <p>1. Sensory nerve cells.</p>
  <p>2.motor neuron</p>
  <p>3.Intermediate nerve cells (interneurons)</p>
  <h3>Sensory nerve cells</h3>
  <p>The function of sensory nerve cells is to transmit impulses from receptors to the central nervous system, namely the brain (encephalon) and spinal cord (spinal cord). The axon endings of sensory nerves are connected to association (intermediate) nerves.</p>
  <h3>Motor nerve cells</h3>
  <p>The function of motor nerve cells is to send impulses from the central nervous system to muscles or glands, the result of which is the body's response to stimulation. Motor neuron cell bodies are located in the central nervous system. The dendrites are very short in contact with the axons of the association nerves, while the axons can be very long.</p>
  <h3>Connective nerve cells</h3>
<p>Connecting nerve cells are also called association nerve cells. These cells can be found in the central nervous system and function to connect motor nerve cells with sensory nerve cells or connect with other nerve cells in the central nervous system. Connective nerve cells receive impulses from sensory receptors or other association nerve cells. Groups of nerve fibers, axons and dendrites join in one sheath and form a nerve. Meanwhile, nerve cell bodies gather to form ganglions or nerve nodes.</p>
