        <h1>What is tectonics plates?</h1> 
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Earth_poster.svg/350px-Earth_poster.svg.png" alt="......" width="600" height="300">
 <p>The outer core of the earth is the inner part of the earth that is located below the earth's crust and above the inner core. This outer core consists of materials that are solid but liquid due to very high temperatures, and is a very important layer in the formation of the Earth's magnetic field. The temperature in the outer core is estimated to reach around 4,000 to 5,000 degrees Celsius.</p> 
 <h1>what contents are found in the earth's core</h1> 
 <p>The earth's core is divided into two parts, namely the inner core and the outer core. The inner core is thought to consist of iron and nickel in a solid state, while the outer core consists of iron and nickel in a liquid state due to the very high temperature. Apart from that, there are also elements such as sulfur, oxygen, and others which also form the composition of the earth's core. This content plays an important role in the earth's geodynamic processes and the formation of the earth's magnetic field.</p>
 <h1>What are the impacts of the Earth's outer core on life</h1>
 <p>The outer core of the Earth plays an important role in maintaining life on Earth because it forms a magnetic field that protects the planet from solar winds filled with harmful particles and radiation. Without the magnetic field generated by the outer core, Earth's atmosphere would be more susceptible to the direct influence of the solar wind, which could have a detrimental impact on life on Earth.</p>
